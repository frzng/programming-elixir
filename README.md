# Programming Elixir

This is a repo I use to complete all the exercises from excellent book
[Programming Elixir: Functional |> Concurrent |> Pragmatic |> Fun](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) by Dave Thomas.

I chose to organize this repository in quite esoteric way. Each
chapter is an orphan branch.

Buy the book, go through it yourself and enjoy the new world bringing
ideas from Erlang, Ruby and Clojure together.
